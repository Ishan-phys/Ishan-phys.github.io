**Barclays Premier League Table - Weekly Update:** 
This project leverages Apache Airflow to schedule web scraping of the Premier League table, extracting leaderboard information. The scraped data is seamlessly ingested into Google BigQuery for efficient storage and analysis. The Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, specifically the BigQuery setup, is orchestrated using Terraform. To enhance portability and scalability, Airflow tasks are encapsulated within a Docker container, facilitated by a customized docker-compose file, ensuring a streamlined and reproducible workflow for periodic data updates.

**Real-Time Anomaly Detection App:** 
Developed a robust three-tier application aimed at delivering a comprehensive machine learning solution for predictive maintenance. The system encompasses a user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit for real-time monitoring of equipment health, a sophisticated machine learning model designed for anomaly detection, and a MongoDB-based database ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of predictions. By seamlessly integrating advanced analytics, cloud technology, and thoughtful user interface design, the application proves highly effective in preventing potential equipment failures and enhancing overall operational efficiency. The system relies on a combination of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data, specifically leveraging the renowned IMS Bearing Data from the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems. Deployed on a cloud platform, the solution not only detects anomalies in real-time but also provides a user-friendly web application displaying predictions, time waveforms, and FFT spectra. The incorporation of MongoDB further contributes to the system's efficiency in proactive equipment maintenance by facilitating seamless storage and retrieval of predictions.

**Paired Image to Image Translation:**
This project centers around the implementation of a Score-based Generative Model designed for paired image-to-image translations. Specifically, I've tackled the challenge of transforming satellite images (Domain A) into their corresponding map-style representations (Domain B) and vice versa. Leveraging the power of PyTorch, a leading deep learning framework, I meticulously trained these models to enable seamless transitions between the two distinct domains. The project not only underscores my proficiency in machine learning and computer vision but also demonstrates the practical application of advanced techniques in solving real-world problems. Explore the showcased transformations to witness the fusion of technology and creativity, showcasing the potential of this Score-based Generative Model in the context of image processing and computer vision.

**CycleGans:**
This project involves the implementation of a CycleGAN model for unpaired image-to-image translation, specifically from Domain A to Domain B. Domain A is composed of digital images from diabetic retinopathy screening, focusing on the retina. In contrast, Domain B comprises images highlighting the vasculature of the same retinal images. Notably, Domain B images feature meticulous annotations crafted by highly trained professionals.

The objective of this project is to automate the generation of annotated images from retinal images, leveraging the power of CycleGAN. This groundbreaking approach signifies a departure from traditional methods, introducing automation to the production of vasculature annotations. The implementation showcases my expertise in advanced image processing techniques, pushing the boundaries of what's achievable in the realm of medical image analysis. Dive into the project to witness the potential impact of CycleGAN in streamlining diabetic retinopathy screening and contributing to the field of automated medical image annotation.
