**Real-Time Anomaly Detection App:** 
I developed a real-time anomaly detection system for monitoring the health of four bearings on a shaft driven by an AC motor. Leveraging a combination of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes sensor data collected from the bearings. The machine learning model is trained on the [IMS Bearing Data](https://www.nasa.gov/intelligent-systems-division/discovery-and-systems-health/pcoe/pcoe-data-set-repository/) from the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems, ensuring adaptability to various patterns indicative of bearing health. Deployed on a cloud platform, the system not only detects anomalies in real-time but also features a user-friendly web application displaying predictions, time waveforms, and FFT spectra. The integration of MongoDB facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of predictions, contributing to a comprehensive solution for proactive equipment maintenance.

This project emphasizes the seamless integration of advanced analytics, cloud technology, and user interface design to create a robust and accessible anomaly detection system. The combination of real-time monitoring, machine learning, and intuitive visualization contributes to its effectiveness in preventing potential equipment failures and enhancing overall operational efficiency.
